# while-loop

a repo about loops in JavaScript

The while statement creates a loop that is executed while a specified condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false

The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the expression becomes false, the loop terminates.
